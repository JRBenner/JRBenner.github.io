        <p class=""><b>Where is he from? </b></p><p class="">Jared Robert Benner was born in Auburn, Washington on December 21, 1990. Jared moved to Naples, 
          Florida when he was six years old with his parents.Although Jared grew up in Southwest Florida, he had gone back to visit family in Washington several times. 
           Jared’s mom moved back to the Central American country of Belize, where she was born, in 2002. So Jared got to spend a lot of summers in Belize, as well as 
           most winter breaks from college. One of the summers in Belize, Jared got dual citizenship with Belize and the U.S. since his mother was born in Belize. 
           Jared loves to travel. Jared has also been to Mexico; Guatemala; Honduras; Haiti; Jamaica; Canada; Oregon; South Carolina; and North Carolina. 
           Jared would love to travel some more in the future. </p>
          <p class=""><b> What is he all about? </b></p><p class=""> Jared loves his family and friends. He grew up with two different families in Naples 
            that consider Jared to be a part of their families because of how long they’ve known each other.  Jared loves to make people smile and make them happy. 
            He feels as though something as simple as a smile can make a difference in someone’s day. People may say that Jared is one of the friendliest people that 
            you could ever meet. Jared works hard at everything he does and likes to put his heart into everything he does.  <br></p>
            <p class=""> Jared had always wanted to be an actor from when he was a little boy in Washington State. His favorite actor to this day is Robin Williams,
                whom he looks up to as an actor. Jared pursued acting at his high school where he did plays and musicals. Jared loved theatre so much that he went on 
                to be a Theatre major at Florida Gulf Coast University. Jared loves entertaining people and hearing their reactions when he’s on stage. But what Jared has
                 always dreamed of doing is acting in film and television. Recently in the year 2018, Jared got to be in his first movie and a short film. Jared wants to 
                 continue adding to his acting resume. Jared has plans of moving back to the west coast by the end of 2018 to continue pursuing his acting dream over there.
